# Semi-frequently Curated FOS Fightstick & Arcade Hardware && Software List (Non-Exhaustive)
---

Herein you may find a limited and very much non exhaustive list of Free && Open-Source *things* for your fightstick, arcade cabinet, pinball machine, lawnmower, etc.

## Software

Ones and zeroes that makes your fightstick go brrrt

- [GP2040-CE](https://gp2040-ce.info/) - RP2040-based multiplatform gamepad firmware (too many people to list, check acknowledgements && contributors)
- [Layout viewer](https://pelsin.github.io/gp2040-ce-layout-viewer/) - Exactly what it says on the tin (Pelsin)

## Main boards & Electronics

The brains of the operation

- [GP2040-CE boards](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Boards) - Bunch of copper that can run the GP2040-CE firmware (the OpenStick Community at large)

- [DaemonBite Arcade Encoder](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Arcade-Encoder) - MiSTer FPGA oriented mainboard. **Based on an Arduino Pro Micro, so it will not be compatible with GP2040-CE !** (MickGyver)
